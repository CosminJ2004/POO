# Brawlers Game

Brawlers Game is a text-based game implemented in C++, where players can engage in various activities such as unboxing brawlers, playing different game modes, trying their luck at roulette, selling brawlers, and managing their in-game balance.

## Features

### 1. Unbox Brawlers
Players have the option to unbox brawlers by spending in-game currency. Each unboxing session generates a random brawler for the player.

### 2. Play Game Modes
Players can choose to play different game modes, including Gem Grab, Showdown, Heist, Knockout, and Football. They can play either solo or in a team, and their performance affects their in-game rank and experience points (XP).

### 3. Roulette
Players can try their luck at roulette, where they can bet on numbers or colors. The roulette game offers an opportunity for players to increase their in-game currency.

### 4. Sell Brawlers
Players can sell all their brawlers to earn in-game currency. The amount of currency earned depends on the rarity of the brawlers sold.

### 5. Balance Management
Players can track their in-game balance and view their transaction history. They can monitor their spending and earnings throughout the game.
